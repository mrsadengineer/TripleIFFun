# Triple I F Fun

## Introduction 
I am looking to IIIF api specifications. I want to explore different options for handling IIIF request to different server implementation. I am 
publishing these under a single respository, so I can have a single location to refer or compare the routing the uri request.  

Another objective is to practice and create greater understanding on how to use different language platforms with different editors in a single solution. I will be using 
VSCode and Visual Studio 2019 Community.
